# BonghiRefactor
Small and disorderly refactor playground for Visual Studio

## Brief
I'm trying to see if it's possible to create a tool that helps me refactor a library that I've delivered to a client.
I want to be able to know what APIs they are using and how frequently, without asking them to let me see their code.
